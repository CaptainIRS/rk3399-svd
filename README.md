This repository contains the SVD (System View Description) file for the RK3399 SoC from Rockchip.

The SVD file is a description of the memory-mapped registers of the RK3399 SoC. The SVD file can be used to generate device-specific register access code for the RK3399 SoC.

The SVD file is generated from the TRM (Technical Reference Manual) of the RK3399 SoC.

> [!WARNING]
> The SVD file is generated by parsing the TRM of the RK3399 SoC. The SVD file may contain errors. Please verify the SVD file before using it.
