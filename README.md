# RK3399 SVD

[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/CaptainIRS/rk3399-svd?label=Download)](https://github.com/CaptainIRS/rk3399-svd/releases/latest/download/rk3399.svd)

This repository contains the SVD (System View Description) file for the RK3399 SoC from Rockchip.

The SVD file is a description of the memory-mapped registers of the RK3399 SoC. The SVD file can be used to generate device-specific register access code for the RK3399 SoC.

The SVD file is generated from the TRM (Technical Reference Manual) of the RK3399 SoC.

> [!WARNING]
> The SVD file is generated by parsing the TRM of the RK3399 SoC. The SVD file may contain errors. Please verify the SVD file before using it.

> [!NOTE]
> The latest TRM for Rockchip RK3399 is obtained from https://rockchip.fr (v1.3 and v1.4). However in these versions, some chapters seem to be missing, which can be found in earlier versions of the TRM (v1.1 and v1.2). These versions are available at https://web.archive.org/web/20211021044212/https://www.netbsd.org/~mrg/rk3399/.
